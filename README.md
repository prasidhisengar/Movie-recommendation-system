# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that suggests movies to users based on the plot descriptions. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models to analyze movie plots and generate recommendations. The system processes textual data of movies and recommends them based on similarity, helping users discover movies they might enjoy.

## Features
- **Plot-based Recommendations:** Recommends movies based on the content of the plot description.
- **NLP Processing:** Uses NLP techniques to process and understand the movie plots.
- **ML Algorithms:** Implements machine learning models to predict and suggest relevant movies.
- **User Interface:** Provides an interactive UI to enter movie preferences and view recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `Scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms
  - `NLTK / SpaCy`: Natural Language Processing
  - `Flask/Django` (if backend is required for UI)
  - `Tkinter` (if local GUI application)
- **Database:** SQLite / MySQL (if needed for storing movie data)
- **Web Scraping Tools:** BeautifulSoup (if pulling movie data from web sources)
- **Version Control:** Git

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
You can install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup database (if applicable):
Set up the database with movie data or use a pre-existing dataset (e.g., MovieLens dataset).

## Usage

### 1. Preprocessing:
The plot data of movies is preprocessed using NLP techniques to extract useful features (like keywords, key phrases, etc.).

### 2. Model Training:
The recommendation system is built using machine learning algorithms, typically using a similarity-based model (e.g., cosine similarity) or collaborative filtering techniques.

### 3. Generate Recommendations:
To generate recommendations, input a movie title or plot description, and the system will suggest similar movies.

Example:
```python
from recommendation_system import recommend_movies

movie = "Inception"
recommended_movies = recommend_movies(movie)
print(recommended_movies)
```
